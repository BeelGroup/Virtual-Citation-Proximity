# VirtualCitationProximity

This repository contains the code written as part of the Final Year Project: "Virtual Citation Proximity: Using Citation Ground-Truth to Train a Text-Based Machine Learning Model."
The repository contains all of the scripts used to process the Wikipedia data to create the CPI data-set of Citation Proximity Indexes along-side their text features.
Several deep-learning models are also implemented which wer used as part of the project to attempt to predict a Virtual Citation Proximity (i.e. a predicted Citation Proximity Index).
The models were implemented using the machine-learning library Keras.
Included also are all of the scripts used to analyse the data and produce the graphs of the results.
